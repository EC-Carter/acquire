# acquire.

[App Deployed Here](https://e-c-carter-acquire.netlify.app/)

Hi Team, 

Thanks for giving me the opportunity to submit a project for your consideration! I have created a simple app called acquire. that allows the company to manage potential acquisition targets as per the brief. I have included some additional search and sort features as well. I choose to use bootstrap for styling and responsive layout due to the time constraints of the project. I also choose to manage state with redux. Please let me know if you have any questions!

## MVP
  -  Application has Create, Read, Update, and Delete, operations for a dataset. 
  -  Must capture company overview, contacts and financial data for each target in dataset.
  -  Must implement attractive responsive design.
  
## Stretch Goals
  - Add filter and search feature for the dataset on main menu - Completed
  

## Next Steps
As I continue working on this project I would like to focus on:
  - Refactoring AddEditForm.js to make use of nested form components and clean up the lengthy financial info portion of the form
  - Refine responsive behavior at all breakpoints, specifically the search and sort features
  - Add pagination to results shown in MainDisplay.js
  - Include more options in the search and sort feature
  - Add custom error handling for form
  - Refactor and add elements to increase accessibility 
  - Add charts to visualize financial datasets in TargetDisplay.js
